# In progress

I'm working on the Harvard Business Review data set (a [kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/) [thing](https://www.kaggle.com/c/harvard-business-review-vision-statement-prospect/)). I want to make the timeline more physically intuitive and more closely linked to the pages of HBR. I'm using R with knitr (R markdown), so the source file is the .Rmd one, and the corresponding .md and .html are output that is prettier and shows output for you (on the github web site, the markdown is rendered nicely).
